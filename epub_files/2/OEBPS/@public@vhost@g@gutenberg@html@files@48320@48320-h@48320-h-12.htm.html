<p class="center p150"><strong>R. D. BLACKMORE’S NOVELS.</strong></p>
<p>His descriptions are wonderfully vivid and natural. His pages are brightened everywhere with great humor; the quaint, dry turns of thought remind you occasionally of Fielding.—<cite>London Times.</cite></p>
<p>Mr. Blackmore always writes like a scholar and a gentleman—<cite>Athenæum</cite>, London.</p>
<p>His tales, all of them, are pre-eminently meritorious. They are remarkable for their careful elaboration, the conscientious finish of their workmanship, their affluence of striking dramatic and narrative incident, their close observation and general interpretation of nature, their profusion of picturesque description, and their quiet and sustained humor. Besides, they are pervaded by a bright and elastic atmosphere which diffuses a cheery feeling of healthful and robust vigor. While they charm us by their sprightly vivacity and their naturalness, they never in the slightest degree transcend the limits of delicacy or good taste. While radiating warmth and brightness, they are as pure as the new-fallen snow.... Their literary execution is admirable, and their dramatic power is as exceptional as their moral purity.—<cite>Christian Intelligencer</cite>, N. Y.</p>

<p>In all of Captain King’s stories the author holds to lofty ideals of manhood and womanhood, and inculcates the lessons of honor, generosity, courage, and self-control.—<cite>Literary World</cite>, Boston.</p>
<p>The vivacity and charm which signally distinguish Captain King’s pen.... He occupies a position in American literature entirely his own.... His is the literature of honest sentiment, pure and tender.—<cite>N. Y. Press.</cite></p>
<p>A romance by Captain King is always a pleasure, because he has so complete a mastery of the subjects with which he deals.... Captain King has few rivals in his domain.... The general tone of Captain King’s stories is highly commendable. The heroes are simple, frank, and soldierly; the heroines are dignified and maidenly in the most unconventional situations.—<cite>Epoch</cite>, N. Y.</p>
<p>All Captain King’s stories are full of spirit and with the true ring about them.—<cite>Philadelphia Item.</cite></p>
<p>Captain King’s stories of army life are so brilliant and intense, they have such a ring of true experience, and his characters are so lifelike and vivid that the announcement of a new one is always received with pleasure.—<cite>New Haven Palladium.</cite></p>
<p>Captain King is a delightful story-teller.—<cite>Washington Post.</cite></p>
<p>In the delineation of war scenes Captain King’s style is crisp and vigorous, inspiring in the breast of the reader a thrill of genuine patriotic fervor.—<cite>Boston Commonwealth.</cite></p>
<p>Captain King is almost without a rival in the field he has chosen.... His style is at once vigorous and sentimental in the best sense of that word, so that his novels are pleasing to young men as well as young women.—<cite>Pittsburgh Bulletin.</cite></p>
<p>It is good to think that there is at least one man who believes that all the spirit of romance and chivalry has not yet died out of the world, and that there are as brave and honest hearts to-day as there were in the days of knights and paladins.—<cite>Philadelphia Record.</cite></p>

<p class="center p150"><strong>BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE CHRIST.</strong></p>
<p class="hang p110">By <span class="smcap">Lew. Wallace</span>. 16mo, Cloth, $1 50. <cite>Garfield Edition.</cite> Two Volumes. Twenty Full-page Photogravures. Over 1000 Illustrations as Marginal Drawings by <span class="smcap">William Martin Johnson</span>. Crown 8vo, Printed on Fine Super-calendered Plate-paper, Uncut Edges and Gilt Tops, Bound in Silk and Gold, $7 00. (<i>In a Gladstone Box.</i>)</p>
<p>Anything so startling, new, and distinctive as the leading feature of this romance does not often appear in works of fiction.... Some of Mr. Wallace’s writing is remarkable for its pathetic eloquence. The scenes described in the New Testament are rewritten with the power and skill of an accomplished master of style.—<cite>N. Y. Times.</cite></p>
<p>Its real basis is a description of the life of the Jews and Romans at the beginning of the Christian era, and this is both forcible and brilliant.... We are carried through a surprising variety of scenes; we witness a sea-fight, a chariot-race, the internal economy of a Roman galley, domestic interiors at Antioch, at Jerusalem, and among the tribes of the desert; palaces, prisons, the haunts of dissipated Roman youth, the houses of pious families of Israel. There is plenty of exciting incident; everything is animated, vivid and glowing.—<i>N. Y. Tribune.</i></p>
<p>From the opening of the volume to the very close the reader’s interest will be kept at the highest pitch, and the novel will be pronounced by all one of the greatest novels of the day.—<cite>Boston Post.</cite></p>
<p>“Ben Hur” is interesting, and its characterization is fine and strong. Meanwhile it evinces careful study of the period in which the scene is laid, and will help those who read it with reasonable attention to realize the nature and conditions of Hebrew life in Jerusalem and Roman life at Antioch at the time of our Saviour’s advent.—<cite>Examiner</cite>, N. Y.</p>
<p>The book is one of unquestionable power, and will be read with unwonted interest by many readers who are weary of the conventional novel and romance.—<cite>Boston Journal.</cite></p>
<p>One of the most remarkable and delightful books. It is as real and warm as life itself, and as attractive as the grandest and most heroic chapters of history.—<cite>Indianapolis Journal.</cite></p>
